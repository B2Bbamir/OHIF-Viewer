      The smart CT brush tool allows you to segment specific tissue types of CT
      images based on a pair of Hounsfield Units (HU). The tissue type can be

      This option allows you to select the tissue type the Smart CT brush uses.
      You can also specify a custom gate in Hounsfield Units.

    <h5>Smart/Auto Gate Settings</h5>
    <p>These settings affect both the Smart CT and Auto Brush tools.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first slider sets the size of holes to fill in whilst painting, as a
        fraction of the primary region painted within the brush circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        The second slider sets the size of non-primary regions to ignore whilst
        painting, as a fraction of the primary region painted within the brush
        circle. Regions smaller than this threshold will not be painted.
      </li>

const segments = (
  <div>
    <p>
      A segment is defined as a 3D mask of a particular color, defining one
      region of interest. The Segments side panel displays a list of segments
      displayed on the scan in the active viewport, as well as some global
      settings for brush tools.
    </p>

    <h5>Segment List</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the "+ Segment" button to add a new segment.</li>
      <li>
        Click on a button in the Paint column to select which color to paint.
      </li>
      <li>Click on a segment's label or type to edit its metadata.</li>
      <li>Click hide to hide a segment.</li>
      <li>
        Click delete to delete a segment from your working collection. You will
        be asked to confirm your choice, as this can't be done.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Import</h5>
    <p>
      You may overlay one labelmap on a scan at a time. This limitation is due
      to memory limitations within the browser, and will be improved in the
      future. You may edit the labelmap and re-save it as a new ROI Collection.
    </p>

    <h5>Export</h5>
    <p>
      You can export the labelmap. Overlapping segments are valid and can be
      exported.
    </p>
  </div>
