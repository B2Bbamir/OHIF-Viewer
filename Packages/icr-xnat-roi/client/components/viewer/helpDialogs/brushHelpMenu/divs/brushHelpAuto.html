    <p>
      The Auto Brush tool finds the minimum and maximum pixel values within the
      brush radius when pressing down the mouse. Dragging after pressing down
      the mouse will only fill in pixels within this band.
    </p>

    <p>
      Holes/artifacts are filled and stray pixels removed, based on the
      settings configured in the Brush Settings Menu.
