    <p>
      The brush tool allows you to draw pixel masks on images. If you are
      drawing on a DICOM image segmentations you draw are allowed to overlap.
      If you are drawing on a NIFTI image (not yet implemented), or editing an
      imported NIFTI mask, then segmentations overwrite each other and my not overlap.
    </p>

    <h5>Painting with the brush</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the canvas to paint with the selected color.</li>
      <li>Drag to make brush strokes.</li>
      <li>Use the + and - keys to increase/decrease the brush size.</li>
      <li>Use the [ and ] keys to change the mask color.</li>
      <li>Ctrl + click with the brush to erase that mask color.</li>
      <li>Use the N key to quickly switch to the first unused segmentation color.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Known issues</h5>
    <p>
      Masks do not render properly on rotated images. This is due to they way
      the underlying library renders annotations. This should be possible to fix
      in the future.
