    <p>
      The brush tool allows you to draw pixel masks on images, which can later
      be exported to DICOM-SEG objects if drawing on DICOM images, or NIFTI masks
      if drawing on NIFTI images. In this alpha the current exports are available:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>DICOM-SEG: Not yet implemented.</li>
      <li>NIFTI: Not yet implemented.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Painting with the brush</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the canvas to paint with the selected color.</li>
      <li>Drag to make brush strokes.</li>
      <li>Use the + and - keys to increase/decrease the brush size.</li>
      <li>Use the [ and ] keys to change the mask color.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Known issues</h5>
    <p>
      Masks do not render properly on rotated images. This is due to they way
      the underlying library renders annotations. This should be possible to fix
      in the future.
