    <p>
      When interpolation is turned on, when new contours are drawn
      intermediate contours of an ROI are estimated by linear interpolation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interpolated contours are denoted by a dotted line.</li>
      <li>Interpolated contours are recalculated everytime a source contour (solid line) is edited.</li>
      <li>If you edit an interpolated contour, it becomes a source contour.</li>
      <li>Interpolation won't occur if there are multiple contours of the same ROI on a branch.</li>
    </ul>
