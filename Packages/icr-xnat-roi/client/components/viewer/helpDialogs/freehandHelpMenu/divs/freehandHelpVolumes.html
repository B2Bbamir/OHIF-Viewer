      A "Region of Interest" (ROI) is defined as a collection of contours
      that make up a continuous volume. The ROI Management interface accessed
      through the ROI menu contains a list of the currently active ROIs, and
      allows for the creation of new ROIs. Clicking on an ROI in the list will
      allow activate that ROI for drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid potential duplication, imported and exported ROIs are locked for
      editing. These can still be viewed in the ROI manager by toggling
      "view locked ROIs".
